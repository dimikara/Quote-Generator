# Quote-Generator

A motivational quotes machine.

Can be run directly here: 

[https://dimikara.github.io/Quote-Generator/](https://dimikara.github.io/Quote-Generator/)

I originally made it in order to get one motivational quote per day during the `#50daysofUdacity` challenge for my [Microsoft Scholarship Foundation course in Machine Learning](https://dimikara.github.io/50DaysOfUdacity/).
